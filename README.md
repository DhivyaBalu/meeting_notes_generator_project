# meeting_notes_generator_project
The Meeting Notes Generator is a Streamlit-based application that leverages LLM (Llama 3) to automatically generate structured meeting notes from a given transcript. It extracts key discussion points, decisions made, action items with assignees, and unresolved questions, providing a well-structured and professional summary of meetings.
