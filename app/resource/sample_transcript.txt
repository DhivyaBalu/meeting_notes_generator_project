Alex: Welcome, everyone. Let's start with an update on where we stand with the cloud migration project. Jordan, can you share the current status?

Jordan: Sure, Alex. We've completed the migration of 60% of the applications to AWS. The initial tests show improved performance metrics, but there are some concerns with latency in certain regions.

Alex: Thanks, Jordan. Taylor, any updates on the infrastructure setup?

Taylor: Yes, we’ve set up the auto-scaling policies and configured monitoring tools. However, we need more clarity on the cost optimization strategy before we proceed further.

Alex: Noted. Morgan, what’s the status of database migration?

Morgan: We’ve migrated three out of five databases. The large transaction database is scheduled for next week, but we need downtime approval to proceed.

Alex: Understood. Riley, how about QA?

Riley: We’ve completed functional testing for the migrated applications, but integration testing is pending. We also need test data for the large transaction database.

Alex: Good progress overall. Let’s address the challenges now. Jordan, you mentioned latency issues. Can you elaborate?

Jordan: The latency is primarily in the APAC region. I suspect it's due to the absence of edge locations nearby.

Alex: Is there a workaround?

Jordan: Yes, deploying a CloudFront distribution should help.

Taylor: I can configure CloudFront and run some tests.

Alex: Great. Morgan, what do you need for the database downtime approval?

Morgan: We need approval from the business stakeholders. I’ll draft the request.

Alex: Riley, for the test data, can we extract it from the current system?

Riley: Yes, but it will require support from the database team.

Morgan: I’ll coordinate with my team and share the required data.

Alex: Excellent. Let's move to cost optimization. Taylor, what’s the main challenge there?

Taylor: The main issue is tracking real-time costs. We need to set up AWS Budgets and alerts.

Jordan: I can help with that.

Alex: Perfect. Now, let’s list action items.
